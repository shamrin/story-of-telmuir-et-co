## Story

We are in the archepelago of .... It's made of non-huge islands, but some island are very high, made of unnatural material. We are not sure what material is. It's a living place of fishmen. We see around ourselves higher towers. It's now midday. We have been promised that ship. We are now in Xendrik, but we were in the Norther part. There are visible rings in the sky. Story of creation is as follows: in were three dragons (Kiber - evil, killed Siberians turned into ash and rings, ...)

Compass looks broken in Xendrik.

We saw dragon shards, for example one was on the airship that was powered by one of them.

## Happened in this session

We are all exhausted, there are a couple fishmens (Sahogi). And airship is coming to get us. We have just defeated pirates, and one pirate is roped.

Sylv: "Should we kill him?"

Thule: is trying to intimidate the pirate. The pirate is extemelly feareful of barbarian Thule. His thinking is crumbpled, all hope is escaping.

Telmuir: let's not kill him of scare.

Pirate starts to cry and shiver. Please don't kill me.

Telmuir: who are working for, please tell us.

Pirate continues crying. He never saw such a huge barbirian. "I don't know, please don't hurt me. I got paid ..."

Thule: who paid you?

Pirate: baron paid me, his name is Utrack.

Me: I remember that name. I can confirm. Baron is the pirate lord. He keeps his base is at Tree-barel cove (where pirates are from). His is very powerful by his reputation. He can kill multiple men in one strike. I have heard lead-from-the-front type of guy.

Telmuir: sounds like a guy for Thule. What do you use sour wood for?

Pirate: I don't know...

Sylv: shall we cut a finger from a pirate?

Fishmen takes the corpse and carry away. Fishmen priest (that one who ressurcted two of us) asks to follow the group with him.

(8 hours left until airship arrives)

The group cannot talk to the fishmen priest, no common language.

Trying to decide what to do. Decided to follow fishmen, and take pirate with the group.

Started walking.

Can see super tall columns (spires, made of demon glass) in the front. Are interested in the material.

Continue walking, in the vast jungle.

Island is not too big, making a way to the beach, very slowly. Fishmen are annoyed and inpatient because the group is slow. And the captive is crying quietly. And 1,5 hours we have noticed we haven't travelled too long. And fishmen are pointing to the sea. And one warrier is already diving into the sea with a corpse.

Olivia: should we dive after them? how well do we swim?

Warriors dive into the sea. Priest looks at us. Points at the beach and dives. No fishmen left, we are at the beach. But there are beautiful spires around us.

Telmuir suggests we can rest.

Me agrees.

We only have time for short rest, except the Sylv.

Olivia suggests we can investigate the demon glass. Telmuir says we cannot chip away from it, it's very strength. Nobody was able to take the piece away ever. It's opaque whitish rock with some holes and caves up top, no even surfaces.

Sylv suggests to try to put the pirate head into the water to test the water.

Telmuir wants to persuade the pirate to find out why the tree was chopped down: "how much are you paid for chopping down wood". "I was paid as a marksmen." - "I don't know where does it go." - "We wanted to discover the wood."

Group realized that the guy is useless and does not know shit.

Sylv, Thule and Rumata decided to put the pirate head into water. Barely had enough strength to carry the pirate. Managed to put his hand into the water. Lot's of bubbles go to the surface. Keep the pirate in the water, bubbles run out, pirates life is fading away. Lifeless body. Rumata says it was a mistake. Sylv says there was no spell.

Decided to rest. Sylv goes to deep rest. Rumata restored all health after short rest. Telmuir restored some health back.

Water starts to bubble, fishmen come back, priest and the warriors. They noticed the dead body on the beach. And they started to be angry and one warrier takes the body and dives to the depth.

Fishmen brought cooked something that looks maybe like a meat. Telmuir has good understanding what is poison or not, based on looking at the dish and smelling it. There are *some* small hints of poison. Sylv dreams of human flesh. Nobody can say for sure, but it's not the fish. Rumata and Telmuir both take a bite. Tastes like chicken, but quite chewy. Got some really unhealthy, very bad fealing, almost throw up, but managed not to throw up. No serious negative effect. Fishmen are very happy, they leave some more food on the beach and all fishmen leave and dive into the sea. 

Sylv is still sleeping. Sun has moved passed the high sky and started to lower.

Telmuir wants to lie down under the tree. But there are already a shadow under the spire. He is digesting and happy.

Olivia wants to look around a bit, if there is anyone outside. Her monk senses does not tell there is anyone around.

4 hours passes, Sylv wakes up. Got all his abilities back and health back. Sun is started to set.

Sylv reminds that we should go back to randevue point where the airship should arrive, in the middle of an island, where the crash site was. Now on the beach opposite of pirate landing point. Sylv leads the group back, he is able to remember to navigate back by following the steps.

Sylv is in killing mood, wants to drown Baron pirate. Sylv and Telmuir wants to have wood chopping to stop.

The group tries to remember the past, very badly. Tries to decide who to side with: pirate people, dragon people, fishmen.

Remembered that Rumata's employer was killed by Telmuir. The employer promised some info on Rumata's child. Telmuir realized that Rumata is very angry at him. Continues to walk silently and tried to avoid eye contact.

//Sylv suggests to capture the airship and and find the pirates and find the Rumata's child.

Thule and Telmuir got to the second level of exhaustiion, start to feel really-really bad. (One 8h rest gets only one exhaustion back.)

The group arrived to the crash site, it's smelly there are a lot of corpses, lot's of flies, humidity, hot starts the decomposition process of the corpses.

In the sky the group start to see the dot approaching. Start to recognize that's the ship supposed to picked up the group.

The ship is mostly circling, does not seem to find the group. Even though Telmuir's bonire is on. Sylv tries to shoot flaming arrow in the air, lighted by bonfire and some cloth. Managed to shoot the arrow, just above the tree line. The ship does not notice it. Sylv tries again, another flaming arrow. The arrow not flies way above the tree line. The ship noticed it and started heading to the group.

Airship forms large shadow above. They dropped the rope ladder. Unsure if everybody can climb up, especially since many people are exhausted. Oliva goes first. "I know what I'm doing" she thought and got too comfortable, slipped and started to fall from 20f height. However, managed to slow the fall and landed on the ground, getting hurt. Sylv got next to the same height, but there was a strong gust of wind, fortunately Sylv got on top.

- Storm is approaching, how many of you are here?
- 4
- why not 3?
- we got a dude, I can vouch for him
- ok! we have ropes and we can levitate two people, there is not enough magic for more.

Telmuir: why the rope?
Sylv: why the rope?
Ship: it's a safety rope, idiot.

Telmuir starts to climb while safety-roped, but than he changed his mind, unroped, turned into squirel and started to climb in squirel form. However, there was strong gust of wind at the same place as with Sylv. With great difficulty squirel reached the top and turned into a dwarf immediatly.

- Hurry up!

Thule ropes up and starts climbing next. While extremelly exhausted white-knuckled only with upper body strength. Strong gust of wind again happened. Spectators amazed on what they see, realizied with amazement that Thule reached the top.

- Hurry up! Maybe you need the levitation? You can just ask us.
- Please levitate Oliva.
- Ask her to stand still.
- Stand still!

Oliva raises to the top with magical levitation almost to the top.

- Sylv please give me a hand!

Sylv easily pulls the rope and Oliva.

- Levitation?
- Yes please.

Rumata levitates up. And attempts to climb the rest of the rope. Managed to climb some steps, but starts to lose the balance. Miracleasly, while Rumata starts to slip, managed to reach down and grab Rumata. But then Sylv starts to fall too. Oliva and Telmuir grasps Sylv's legs and with the shipman help everybody crashed on the floor of the ship.

- Is that all?
- Yes!
- We need to leave.

On the ship, three guards (different from before) asks the group to see the captain and escort them to the bridge. Same captain. Up to five guards are around all familiar. Beatiful and deadly looking Lazea:

Capt: - You have found your friends. There is even one more as I can see.
Sylv: - Yes, all friends.
Telmuir: - I'm Telmuir.
Sylv: - They have found something.
Telmuir: - We have stormed the incoming airship, but the ship crashed. There was a mage.
Capt: - Was the mage wearing the mark?
Telm: - Did not see anything.
Capt: - Wher3e is the mage?
Telm: - Dead. We have learned there's a traitor on the ship. And we have learned there are pirates who are after the sour wood.
Capt: - How many pirates?
Telm: - Enough for me!
Capt: - There were pirates on the hunt for the sour wood?
Telm: - Yes, we took care of them. All dead.
Capt: - Five of you did it with the whole pirate group?
Telm: - Yes we are very skilful.
Capt: - Do you want to rest and continue afterwards. It takes two days. Guards will show you the rooms.

The groups is escorted from the bridge to the passenger quarters of the ship. There is some basic food and эйл.

On the back, thunder is rolling. It was good time to leave.

Everybody ate and enjoys some эйл. And managed to recover, some fully.

During the night, dreams start to change for everybody. Dreams are extremelly intense, feeling everything to extreme level. But only for a while.

In the morning everybody woke up, discussing the weird dreams. The group was summoned back to the captain.

Capt: - Did you rest?
Telm: - Yes, thank you!
Capt: - You found the sour wood, managed to find the pirates, managed to kill them all. Who is this halfling?
Telm: - We can go undercover.
Rumata tries to persuade the captain that he know a a lot more.
Capt: - Ok, I'll orgainze the reward for you.
Telm: - I think you have a problem. We can go undercover and help with your problmes and help you pirate and sour wood problems.
Capt looks with cold face and starts nodding: - Maybe you are not stupid. However you have mentioned the Baron. And I don't think you can beat them. But we do have a problem you are right. And the airship got away. And elves did not sell the wood to anyone. Our dragon house representative will be in touch with you. You stay in the city. If you manage to solve the riddle, it will be very helpful. Have you visited the Kovare before?

Arrived to Tralonport city in Kovare (Zilargo area).

(Rumata heard before there was a war across five different nations.)

Capt: - there was a war for 100 years across five kingdom. And the whole kingdom of Sire disappared and turned into Mournland, covered by the mist. It's the mystery. We know how to drive the ships, and the mark is needed which we do have, and you need the rings of course. You can head to the great library in Zolandberg (Zilargo). And the city of Sharn. There are still many mysteries. If you solve it you shall be rewarded. But the enemies - like the Baron - are very powerful.

[see Eberron world]

Sylv: - We do not fear!

Capt: - I also recommend you go to our house capital - Stormhome (north of the continent). And of course you can visit Mournland itself. There is also Lord of Blade, rumored to gather forces in Mournland. I will give you the seal of the house. Looks for our house symbols. There 11 other dragon houses. Now rest.

In the morning the group start to coastal area of Kovare and dock into the Trolanport. It's modern beyond our imagation. City is bright and clean. It's known for its Amsterdam-like canals. The ship is attached to flying dock. Everybody receives each a seal of house of Lurander. Capt: - stay here and wait for intructions. please learn the way of the land.

We go down the the ground. But on the way we are greeted by two gnomes in dark clothers: - we are from the trust, what's your purpose of coming here.

- Business and pleasure
- You have arrived on the special ship along!
- We are helping House of Lurander. Here is the seal.

Gnomes check the seal of the house:
- Welcome to the city! How can I help you?
- Do you have a map?
- You can find a map at the house of Sivis. Please don't do any violence.
- What if somebody makes violence to us?
- Tell us. Violence is not tolerated in these streets. Enjoy your time.

Gnomes disappeares into the crowd.

We start wondering.

(Rumata manages to still 7 coins from Telmuir because he proudly told he has a 100 coins.)

Started to follow the canals to the center.

All of gnomes. One of two full-metal sentinel beings, doing their own things.

In the city center gnome notices us:

- Given your cloth has seen better days? Do you want to look fresh again?
- Thule: How much?
- Gnome: 1 gp!
- Thule: 0,5 gp and I let you live!
- Gnome: 7 silver pieces.
- Thule: 5 silver pieces.
- Gnome: What about clothes for all of you, 3 gp. 

Gnome snap fingers and Thule's clothes appear new and clean suddenly.

Thule: - Is it an illusion?
Gnome: - No, it's not.

Haggle for the price. Until 2,5. All of our cloth become shiny and new. It's not super fashionable, but okay for a working class.

Started to look for a House of Sivis seal. Spotted super fancy glitter building, with a ugly-chicken-candle-dragon seal, guarded by nasty-looking gnomes. But okay to walk in. There is a service counter. Discussing about queueing culture.

Lady at the counter: - Next please! Five? How can I help you?
Sylv: - we need a map!
Lady: - Where are you from?
Oliva: - From Centrik. And lodging, and recommendation, and magical arrows.
Lady: - Yes, of course, but long-bows are in use in the whole continent. Short-bow are okay though. Armor, but very expensive.
Telmuir: - I am rich.
Lady: - Yes, of course.
Oliva: - What about new cloth? For adventure.
Lady: - Blacksmith and some old fashion people from the former Sire.
Sylv: - And sexy armor.
Telmuir: - And adventure gear.
Lady: - We have docks, go there.
Telmuir: - What about weapons?
Lady: - Non popular anymore, sorry.
Sylv: - Potions.
Lady: - In the Smith area.
Telmuir: - Magic items?
Lady: - You would have better luck in the library in Zolanberg.
Lady: - What House are you with?
Telm: House of Lorander.

Lady gives us the map of blacksmith area and dock area:

- There are a lot of fine establishment, like taverns and places to sleep.

Start to head for blacksmith area. On the way we have noticed that nobody wears an armor in the city. Seems that people are not worried about violence. But we do find some blacksmiths (BS):

BS: - How can I help you?
Telm & Sylv: - Armor please!
BS: - 15000 GP!
Sylv: - Out of my range a bit unfortunately.
Telm: - Maybe slightly better studded leather armor that what we have?
BS: - Yes, 45 GP.
Telm: - What about my current leather armor as exchange and 30 GP?
BS: - Yes, we get that a lot, sorry. (We notice there is a whole shelve of leather armor.)
Telm: - Ok, 45 GP.

Potion shop (PS):

PS: - How can I help you?
Sylv: - Speed potion maybe?
PS: - Heal potion. 45 GP
Sylv: - Expensive...

Rumata tries to steal one, but fails. Fortunately not caught.

Found a place called "Warrior and mug", ate and drank.
