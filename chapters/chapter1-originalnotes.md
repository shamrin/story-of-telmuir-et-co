# Quest of Telmuir and Co.

## Actors in the Game:

**Telmuir, Dwarf Druid**

Telmuir left his Hill Dwarf community at an early age since he has always been inexplicably drawn by the wonders of the nature above the ground.
He joined the druidic enclave called Circle of the Whispering Pines where learned to tap into the natural energies of the earth and the
celestial bodies above.

During his time at the Circle of the Whispering Pines he also befriended with a fellow student, an elf named Sylvanus. Sylvanus and Telmuir ended
sharing experiences, learning, exploring and adventuring together, forming a bond of friendship and mutual respect.

Eventually Telmuir felt the draw of the nature beyond the secluded grove too powerful and decided to leave his circle to explore the nature and the world
and to share the wisdom of nature.

Through Sylvanus Telmuir also got to know Thuule, the human barbarian. Although Telmuir was initially cautios of the boisterous and battle-loving human, he soon
learned to appreciate Thuule's respect for tradition and his fierce loyalty to his friends.

**Rumata, Halfling Rogue**

**Sylvanus, Elf Ranger**

**Thuule, Human Barbarian**

**Oliva, Human Monk**

## Happened in past
Our party accidentally ended up coming together in a city of Stormreach where Sylvanus was enjoying local brewery products.
First he was joined by his old drinking budy Thuule and soon also by Telmuir and Oliva. Except for Rumata the halfling, our party was back together!

Party was approached by Nivix the gnome to find soarwood. Nivix offered a quest to the party to chart nearby islands (Shargon's Teeth) for soarwood,
a rare tree that can be used to manufacture airships, flying ships that sail the skies.

Telmuir was immediatelly intrigued by the offer since he had never seen a live soarwood in the past, although he had heard and read about them. Seeing
one in wild would be a dream come true!

Due to some turns in the plot, the party however ended up hired to guard a flyship to Kuvair instead. The route from Stormreach to Kuvair happened to
go over Shargon's Teeth, though.

During the passage, the airship was attacked by another, dark airship. Group of orcs and gnomes from the attacking airship boarded
our airship and a battle ensued. Suddenly the group of orcs and gnomes was also joined by one of the passangers who was clearly
in the same plot with the attackers. 

Our party defeated the orcs and gnomes. The attacking airship started to withdraw and descend from the side of our airship.

In order to understand why our airship was attacked, Oliva and Telmuir (at this stage in the form of a brown bear) decided to storm the rogue airship and jumped from the airship to another.
Rest of the party (Sylvanus and Thuule) didn't make it to the attacking airship before the distance between these two became too big thus the party was split into two.
